You need to write a function called is_prime() that checks whether if the number passed into it is a prime number or not.  It should return True or False.
e.g.
7 is a primer number because it is only divisible by 1 and itself.
But 4 is not a prime number because you can divide it by 1, 2 or 4.
NOTE: 2 is a prime number because it's only divisible by 1 and itself, but 1 is not a prime number because it is only divisible by 1.

Example Input 1
73
Example Output 1
True

Example Input 2
75
Example Output 2
False

Code-

import math

def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    if n == 2:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    max_divisor = math.isqrt(n)
    for i in range(3, max_divisor + 1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

time complexity is O(âˆšn)
